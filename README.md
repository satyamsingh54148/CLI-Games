Basic Games 

Game 1 : Hangman : CLI Based Project
    I have created a simple single player word-guessing game inspired by Hangman.
    The game has been developed in python using PyCharm.
    I have used the concepts of Data Structure ( i.e. - List and Dictionary), upper() method and randint() method.
    
Game 2 : Tic - Tac - Toe : CLI Based Project
    This is a basic implementation of the famous 2-player game 'Tic - Tac - Toe'.
    The game has been developed in python using PyCharm.
    I have used the concepts of Data Structure ( i.e. - List) and global variables
